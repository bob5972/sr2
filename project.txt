Next Steps:
* filters on inputs
* MatrixFleet
** Neural inputs/outputs with just linear combinations
* New simpler ShipAI
** Less hashing, more flexibility

Fleet Ideas:
* Missile Flocking
* Angular/Linear Speed Conversions (for Neural)
* Formation forces
* Threat/Kill zones (offense and defense)
* Enemy base guess 2 (project from conflict zones)
* Line of control (Slow movement like a locus?)
* Inside / Outside Control
* Friends between self and enemy
* New Loci
** Closest/Forward Locus selector force
** Conflict Force/Locus
** Unexplored Locus

Models:
* Squad/Output Combiners (Condition + Sum Set of Outputs)
* Vector Net

Tech Debt / Quality of Life:
* Remove FLEET_AI_NEUTRAL dependency in players[0]
* Measure specific fleet from population
* Extra iterations for upstarts
* Cache advance/retreat dir (avoid FPoint_ToFRPoint calls)
